Indivicivet: now imagine the points (1,0) and (-1,0) in the plane


say call them a,b. then the inequality |x-1| + |x+1| > 3 is the same as saying
"the sum of the distance from a and the distance from b is greater than 3"

so if you have a rope of length 3, and you want it to cover a->point->b, then for
that point, "the sum of the distance from a and the distance from b is *at most* 3"
... so physically imagine attaching your rope to those points ((1,0) and (-1,0))
and moving it around

the area you can cover is precisely where |x-1|+|x+1| <= 3
eivarv has joined (~eivarv@cm-84.215.4.97.getinternet.no)

so, everywhere you CAN'T cover satisfies your original inequality

then you just imagine restricting that to the real line

you have your two points a and b, and the coloured lines are ways to set up the rope such that
it goes to some point and the rope's length is at most 3 (it's a rope, so you can let it go slack, but it won't stretch); then that gives you the gray shaded area, which is everywhere you can put your point

then that's where your original inequality is *not* satisfied

so it's satisfied outside of that.
And in particular, since you want x on the real line and not on the plane, it's the intersection with the line y=0 ;
ie the dotted thing. so the area you want is the pink highlighted bits outside

by the way, because the rope has length 3, the left side of the ellipse is at (-1.5, 0) (because that's dist 0.5 from a and 2.5 from b = 3) and the right side is (1.5, 0)

What is the method? how do you first take |x+1| and intuit how to get -1 , 1 ?
answer:
|x+1| is the distance between x and -1    ****

because the distance between a, b is |a-b|


Svitkona: all you need to do is think about the definition of |x|

|x| = x if x >= 0; -x otherwise
