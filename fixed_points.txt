A function in mathematics is a map between input and output values. Fixed
points are input values (for a function) which map to output values satisfying
equality with the input.

For the equality function

f(x) = x

the set of input value is equal to the set of fixed points of the function.

For a function

f(x)= x^2

the set of fixed points is limited to {0, 1} .


Imagine we are trying to define the factorial function: remember the definition
of the factorial function:

(define (fact n)
(if (= n 1) 1
(* n (fact (- n 1)))))

Now in some PL frameworks (namely the λ-calculus), it isn't immediately obvious
how to define such a function. However, it may be easy to define the following
higher-order function, so-called because it takes as input another function and
a natural number :

Fact f 0 = 1
Fact f (+ n 1) = n * (f n)

There is no use of recursion in this function definition. However, if there was
some way of finding the fix-point of Fact, that is, a function ϕ such that :

Fact ϕ n = ϕ n

for every n, then it is easy to check that ϕ is indeed an implementation of the
factorial function.
